## Mini Project 2

This assumes you have PyPy installed. If not please consider using Pyenv to switch to an appropriate version of Python.

Should you need Pypy, and Pyenv instructions for installation can be found [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).

Once Pypy is installed, ensure numpy is also installed for it using
```
pip install numpy
```

Finally run:

```
python line-em-up.py
```

and follow the on screen prompts to run a game.
